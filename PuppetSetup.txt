#Master installation steps on CentOS6x#
#######################################

Install a Release Package to Enable Puppet Labs Package Repositories
First, choose the package based on your specific operating system and version.
The packages are all named using the following convention:
puppetlabs-release-COLLECTION-OS-VERSION.noarch.rpm
Puppet Repository: http://yum.puppetlabs.com

For CentOS6 x86_64: rpm -ivh  http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-6.noarch.rpm

Install Puppet Server
---------------------
as root: yum install puppetserver

Start the puppetserver Service
------------------------------
as root or sudo: service puppetserver start

+-----------------------------+
+Install Puppet on Agent Nodes+
+-----------------------------+

Configure the puppet repository using -
1) rpm -ivh  http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-6.noarch.rpm
2) yum install puppet-agent.
3) sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true.

Additional information when activating the puppet agent/master

Sign Certificates (on the CA Master)
As each agent runs for the first time, it submits a certificate signing request (CSR) to the CA Puppet master. You’ll need to log into that server to check for certs and sign them.

Run sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list to see any outstanding requests.
Run sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign <NAME> to sign a request.
After an agent’s cert is signed, it will regularly fetch and apply configurations from the Puppet master.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Note:
While installing puppet sometimes it complains for the following package:libselinux-ruby
